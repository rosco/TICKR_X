### Android API

The Android API allows you to connect and manage sensor connections and capabilities.
It does so via standard Bluetooth Smart protocols as well as custom/private Wahoo protocols.
In addition to Bluetooth connections, many Android phones support native ANT+ connections for which our API provides an easy interface.

                There are several permissions that you will need for your app to connect to these sensors:

                android.permission.BLUETOOTH
                android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN
                android.permission.WAKE_LOCK
                android.permission.INTERNET
                android.permission.ACCESSNETWORKSTATE
                android.permission.ACCESSFINELOCATION

                A document is included in the API download that will explain in more details on how to interact with the API.
